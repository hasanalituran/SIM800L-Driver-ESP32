# SIM800L-Driver-ESP32

This repository demonstrates how to use SIM800L GSM module with ESP32DevkitC. In this project, communicating the SIM800L module over HTTP and  maintaining the connectivity of the GSM module were the most prioritized tasks. In terms of reconnecting and maintaining the connection, this library did well. Nevertheless, any contribution is welcome.
